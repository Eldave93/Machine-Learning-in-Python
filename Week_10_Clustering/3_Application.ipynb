    "- _\"For instance, suppose that we have a set of n observations, each with p features. The n observations could correspond to tissue samples for patients with breast cancer, and the p features could correspond to measurements collected for each tissue sample; these could be clinical measurements, such as tumor stage or grade, or they could be gene expression measurements. We may have a reason to believe that there is some heterogeneity among the n tissue samples; for instance, perhaps there are a few different unknown subtypes of breast cancer. Clustering could be used to find these subgroups. This is an unsupervised problem because we are trying to discover structure—in this case, distinct clusters—on the basis of a data set.\"_\n",

We may have access to a large number of measurements (e.g. median household income, occupation, distance from nearest urban area, and so forth) for a large number of people. Our goal is to perform market segmentation by identifying subgroups of people who might be more receptive to a particular form of advertising, or more likely to purchase a particular product. The task of performing market segmentation amounts to clustering the people in the data set.\"_<sup>1</sup>\n",
