    "_\"John Zech and colleagues at California Pacific Medical Center wanted to investigate how well neural networks could detect pathologies such as pneumonia and cardiomegaly—enlarged heart—using X-ray images. The team found that their algorithms performed relatively well in hospitals where they were trained, but poorly elsewhere....It turned out that the machine was cueing on parts of the images that had nothing to do with the heart or lungs. For example, X-ray images produced by a portable imaging device had the word PORTABLE printed in the upper right corner—and the algorithm learned that this is a good indicator that a patient has pneumonia. Why? Because portable X-ray machines are used for the most severely ill patients, who cannot easily go to the radiology department of the hospital. Using this cue improved prediction in the original hospital. But it was of little practical value. It had little to do with identifying pneumonia, didn’t cue in on anything doctors didn’t already know, and wouldn’t work in a different hospital that used a different type of portable X-ray machine.\"_<sup>2</sup>"

We would call them up and ask them if they have ever had an affair. But rather than asking them to answer our question directly, we would give them the following instructions: Flip a coin, and don’t tell us how it landed. If it came up heads, tell us (honestly) whether you have ever cheated on your wife. But if it came up tails, tell us a random answer: flip the coin again and tell us yes if it comes up heads and no if it comes up tails. This polling protocol is an example of a simple randomized algorithm. The result is that when we ask people whether they have ever had an affair, three-quarters of the time they tell us the truth (half the time the protocol tells them to tell us the truth, and if instead the protocol tells them to respond with a random answer, then half of that time they just happen to tell us the right answer at random). The remaining one-quarter of the time they tell us a lie. We have no way of telling true answers from lies. We record the answers that they give us—but now everyone has a strong form of plausible deniability...Yet from data collected in this way, it is still possible to get a highly accurate estimate of the fraction of Philadelphia men who have cheated on their wives. The key is that although the individual answers we are collecting are now highly error-prone, we know exactly how those errors are introduced, and so we can work backward to remove them, at least in the aggregate.\"_<sup>15</sup>\n",

On the other hand, the smaller the privacy parameter gets, the more error-prone the process of working backward gets—mapping from the proportion of yes answers in our poll to the actual proportion...\"_<sup>15</sup>\n",
    "- _\"Google and Apple applied differential privacy to data that they weren’t collecting before, rather than to data sources they already had available. Adding privacy protections can be a tough sell to engineers who already have the data available to them. Asking for privacy almost always means a real, measurable degradation in data quality in exchange for a decrease in risk that can feel much more nebulous. It is hard to convince an engineering team to give up access to a clean data source they already have.

From this apparently innocuous data, it then asked you a series of private questions—things you likely never tweeted about (it didn’t read your tweets anyway)—and it would guess the answers. It could accurately guess whether you were pro-choice or pro-life. Whether you thought gay marriage should be legal...it correctly predicted user answers about 85 percent of the time...it was looking only at data you had made public—the list of people you followed on Twitter—and making inferences from information it had about the population at large. It was doing social science on a large scale—it was learning about the world—and by design, differential privacy is not something that would protect you from people making these kinds of inferences about you...as machine learning becomes more powerful, we are able to discover increasingly complicated and non-obvious correlations. Seemingly useless bits of data—the digital exhaust that everyone is constantly producing as they use the Internet, purchasing items, clicking on links, and liking posts—turn out to be surprisingly accurate predictors of other things that we might really wish that other people didn’t know. Differential privacy doesn’t protect you from these kinds of inferences, because the correlations they rely on would exist whether or not your data was available. They are just facts about the world that large-scale machine learning lets us discover. And this is by design—these kinds of privacy risks will always exist whenever people are allowed to study the world and draw conclusions.
