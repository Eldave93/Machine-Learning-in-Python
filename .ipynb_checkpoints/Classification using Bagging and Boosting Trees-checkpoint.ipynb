    "Tree-based classifiers are inherently multiclass\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree breaks data down by asking a series of questions in order to categorise samples into the same class. An algorithm starts at a tree root and then splits the data based on the features that gives the largest information gain. This splitting procedure occours until all the samples within a given node all belong to the same class. A limit on nodes, or tree depth, is often set to avoid overfitting due to a deep tree. To split using information gain relies on calculating the difference between an impurity measure of a parent node and the sum of the impurities of its child nodes; information gain being high when impurity of the child nodes is low. Three impurity measures that are commonly used in binary decision trees are gini impurity, entropy, and the classification error. An ensemble of decision trees can be created to build a more robust model by giving each tree a random bootstrap sample of the data and using a majority voting rule to predict class label<sup>1</sup>. \n",

We can however also undersample using a ballanced random forest. Generally what performs better depends on the amount of data you are training on. If small then class wight will be better (as seen below), but if you have very large datasets, then undersampling will likely work better."
